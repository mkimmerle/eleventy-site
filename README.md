# Static Site - Eleventy Version

This is a newer version of my static personal website, built with the [Eleventy static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev/).

## Documentation

This repo and these docs are very much a work in progress, so stay tuned for updates.

## Installation

First install Eleventy via the instructions in [the Eleventy docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/)

```
npm install @11ty/eleventy --save-dev
```

Once you've cloned this project, run

```
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

## Roadmap

- Self-host web fonts
- Break up main CSS into components
- Set up a build pipeline for live site updates
- Add a blog
